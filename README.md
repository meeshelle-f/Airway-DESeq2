Summary:
Glucocorticoid MOA to suppress inflammation in ASM not understood. 
4 primary human airway smooth muscle (ASM) cell lines were treated with or without dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid. 
Identified 316 DEGs, including DUSP1, KLF15, PER1, TSC22D3, C7, CCDC69, and CRISPLD2 glucocorticoid-responsive genes.
